<h4>🚀 TYPICAL USE CASE OF THIS PLUGIN</h4>
You are building a **big site** with **lots of pages** and you just want it to look amazing. With StarterBlocks you can begin making pages with a variety of "starter blocks," or templates.

You can browse through the categories, as well as collections of like-styled pages. When you find something you like, StarterBlocks makes sure you have everything you need. If a dependency (or required plugin) is missing, you are notified and can install the missing dependency. Worried that our templates may not work with your theme? No problem! With our custom `page templates` options you can transform any site into exactly what you want it to be no matter what them you are using.

Don’t waste hours trying to recreate a design you love. With a click of a button, you have it on your own site and you can begin customizing your "starter block" for your needs.

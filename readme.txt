== Description ==
<strong>StarterBlocks - The Gutenberg Template Library</strong>

Supercharge the Gutenberg editor with nearly 1,000 pre-made templates. Don't start from scratch, start with StarterBlocks!

Browse our ever-growing library of templates to see what is possible within Gutenberg. We take care of all dependency installation for you. You will be able to discovery what's possible and implement any design on your website in virtually no time at all.

Worried that our templates may not work with your theme? No problem! With our page templates you can transform any site into exactly what you want it to be. Don’t waste hours trying to recreate a template you love. With a click of a button it is own website where you can start customizing it for your needs. Missing a plugin the template needs? No worries, we’ll even help you install what you need, all from the Gutenberg editor.

And what’s more is we are block agnostic. That’s a fancy way of saying we don’t force you to use our blocks. So that means if you ever want to uninstall StarterBlocks you can. We have zero vendor lock-in here. We believe in freedom of choice, not product dependence. Let us help you give your website a step up from the competition. So why not give it a try, you’ll be glad you did.
